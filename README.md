# Eleventy custom i18n

This repo shows yet another way to have i18n with an Eleventy static site. I wanted the behavior to looks like to most to how Lektor does it, so it may be a little weird or over-engineered.

To see how it "works" live, have a tour on my [portfolio](https://michaelhubert.me/).
